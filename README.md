### CLONING THE REPO 
git clone https://github.com/tekgourou/Duo_User-Context-Mapping_to_FMC.git <br/>
cd Duo_User-Context-Mapping_to_FMC/scripts <br/>
python3 -m venv venv <br/>
source venv/bin/activate <br/>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br/>

### Prerequisites
This tool use python to establish communications with Duo Admin API and pull the context informations for all athentifications. The REST VDI API is use to share Duo User/IP mapping to FMC. <br/>
Then the tool uses perl to establish communications with FMC to add host profile collected earlier to the Hostprofile in FMC. <br/>

### Python Modules
duo_client (https://pypi.org/project/duo-client/)<br/>
requests <br/>
tinydb <br/>

You will need to get your Duo Admin API key from the Duo Admin Portal.
https://duo.com/docs/adminapi

### FMC Host Input API client certificate
File (xxxxxx.pkcs12) generated from FMC, downloaded in this script's local directory.
To generate the certificate, login to FMC Web GUI and navigate to System -> Integrations -> Host Input Client-> CreateClient->give the IP address of your HOST and DO NOT GIVE a password-> Save. Download the pkcs12file in this script's local directory.


### Running this script
Before running the following command ensure that all prerequisites are met and run it in the script directory loaded.
To run the tool simply execute: <br/>
<br/>
python3.6 Duo_to_FMC.py <br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to run the script with crontab (linux) or Task Scheduler (Microsoft) every 5 minutes. <br/>
